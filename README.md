# Project Description



-I have created a data science project for University of Starling UK, with the requirement to determine the amount of Carbon emitted, the Carbon usage, and the Carbon inventory based on their data from 2016 to 2022. Essentially, I performed forecasts (using historical data reports versus future predictions) for this purpose.

-When I started the project, the first step was to extract the data, which was quite time-consuming. After that, I cleaned and transformed the data based on their requirements so that we could feed this clean data to various data science models. To achieve this, I organized the project into yearly scopes, allowing us to understand how much Carbon was emitted in Scope 1, Scope 2, and so on.

-During the deep transformation of the data, I discovered other elements related to Carbon, such as electricity. So, I extracted all the related data to Carbon. Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, I created plots based on the requirements. These plots helped us understand the amount of Carbon emitted and the amount we managed to save. The end result was comparing the Carbon footprint in the previous scopes with the savings in the current scope.

-Next, we moved towards data science modeling. I utilized seasonality models, ARIMA model, SARIMA model, and FP Growth model. These models analyze the patterns in our previous data and provide forecasts for future predictions, giving insights into the expected Carbon footprints for the next 8 or 10 years, assuming the environment remains similar.
